        <h2>Bud Like You</h2>
          <br>Way up, way up, way up to the sky
          <br>When everybody here is sneaking in and getting high
          <br>Way up, way up, way up to the moon
          <br>Boy, it's good to know I got a bud like you
          <br>Enough, enough
          <br>There's no celebrities here
          <br>So why's the bouncer taking everything so seriously?
          <br>It's you, and I
          <br>It's cool you feel the same
          <br>Like why's the DJ here if he's just pressing play?
          <br>Kickin' in the basement, kickin' in the basement
          <br>Hatin' all the same things too
          <br>If I need a pick-me-up, would you come and pick me up?
          <br>I could really use a bud like you
          <br>To pick me
